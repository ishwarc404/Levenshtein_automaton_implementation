# Levenshtein_automata 

This is an implementation of the Levenshtein_automata to compute edit distance of a word.

Two major functions have been implemented in automata_test.py:
 - 1. Given a list of words, when automata_test.py is run, it prints out all the words which are at the specified edit distance.
 - 2. It also tells the minimum number of edits a words will need to get converted into the target word.

Other scripts to depict comparison have also been developed.
